\section{Description and Methodology}
\subsection{Setting up the GPIO}\label{subsection:gpio_setup}
The gamepad created for this course requires some setup to be able to register input (button press) and create output (LED lights). We need to enable the internal pull-ups of the EFM32GG board. We followed the instructions available at \cite[p. 24]{compendium}. Please see \ref{code:gpio_setup.s} and \ref{code:base_addresses.s} for assembly code.

	\subsection{Polling}
	The easiest way to register input, is by continiously polling the button status. The reset handler will in this case initialize the GPIO (as explained in \ref{subsection:gpio_setup}) and start a tight loop.
	The code in \ref{code:polling_reset_handler.s} will read the input registers directly into the LED output register, making each button on the gamepad turn on the LED light with corresponding input number.
