This document describes how to use and power optimize the \boardName~chip with simple assembly programming and other relevant utilites, by implementing a system that allows a user to control a row of LED lights by pressing buttons on a gamepad. This was done by first implementing a simple system, where the power efficiency was optimized by changing the chip's operational state. After the system was put in the highest possible Energy Mode (lowest power consumption) while still functioning correctly, functionality for animating the LEDs was added using the chip's SysTick. In order to make this work, the system had to go down to a much more power consuming Energy Mode. We measured average power consumption of $16.51\mu A$ for our simple application, and $1.233mA$ for the animated one. In other words, if we need access to more advanced utilities, like the SysTick handling, power consumption easily increases by several orders of magnitude.
