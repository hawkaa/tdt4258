\section{Introduction}
The introduction to your document should lead your readers into your paper and give them an ideaof what to expect (also see Forecasting). It should not be simplya restatement of the abstract even though it will contain some ofthe same material.

Introductions often do the following:

State the subject of your document as clearly as possible

Define the problem you are addressing, your approach to the problem, and why this problem is important

State the purpose of your document

Define the scope of your document

Provide necessary and relevant background information

Because the introduction leads your reader into your document, try to begin with a general statementabout the topic before moving on to specific issues. This strategy will help make the topic accessibleto your readers, especially those who are not specialists in the field.
