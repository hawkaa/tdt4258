\section{Evaluation of Assignment}
We are in general very satisfied with the assigment. It gave a good introduction to assembly and microchip programming with a steep learning curve. Still, there are some points we would like to point out:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The compendium states that the exercises are quite open ended, which is good and challenging. We are still uncertain in how open ended, although the question probably is answered with the assesment of this report. We think we have answered this task correctly, but if it turns out we did not, we feel that the assignment should come with a more strict explanation of what to do (and what to not do).
	\item We got an acceptable introduction to the tools and utilites needed to assemble and link the source files, except for the linker scripts. We feel that "Take a look at the delivered linker script for the exercise to get a feel for what the linker scripts are used for" is not sufficient, and we have missed a more detailed explanation of this.
\end{itemize}
