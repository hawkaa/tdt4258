This document describes how to use the EFM32GG-DK3750 to generate wave signals and play various sound effects, using the C programming language without the support of an operating system, using the buttons on the gamepads. This was done by implementing a small framework that easily generates different wave signals and that calculate the disired sounds. The framework also makes it easy to extend with new sound effects. After a sound has been played, the system goes into deep sleep and thereby entering a high Energy Mode (low power consumption). We measured the amperage to 2.988 mA when playing the Tetris Theme song and only 0.213 mA when idle. Even though we managed to reduce the energy consumption level when playing audio, most energy were saved when idle.
