\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Further development}
We are well happy with our solution for the assignment. However, some development could be done to improve both the application and the report. The DAC has an ability to be turned of when not in use. This could improve energy-efficiency for the silent parts during execution. The EFM32GG development board contains a Direct Memory Access unit wich can be used to copy data without CPU intervention. As it was not a requirement for this assignment, we have not used the DMA.
