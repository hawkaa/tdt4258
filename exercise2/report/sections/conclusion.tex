\section{Conclusion}
Even tough we already had some experience with C programming from the Compilers course, this exercise has made us
grow as C programmers. We found the GPIO control to be more or less the exact same as in the previous exercise. The only difference was the language used. The same goes for the interrupt handling. The DAC however, was something neither of us had experience with. Feeding the DAC with data was easy. However, controlling the sound, having multiple tracks playing over each other and creating music required a lot of thinking. Having tested the different types of soundwaves, we learned that the triangle shape gave the smoothest sound but also the lowest. 
\subsection{Further development}
We are well happy with our solution for the assignment. However, some development could be done to improve both the application and the report. The DAC has an ability to be turned of when not in use. This could improve energy-efficiency for the silent parts during execution. The EFM32GG development board contains a Direct Memory Access unit wich can be used to copy data without CPU intervention. As it was not a requirement for this assignment, we have not used the DMA.
