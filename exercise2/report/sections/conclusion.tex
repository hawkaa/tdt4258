\section{Conclusion}
Even tough we already had some experience with C programming from the Compilers course, this exercise has made us
grow as C programmers. We found the GPIO control to be more or less the exact same as in the previous exercise. The only difference was the language used. The same goes for the interrupt handling. The DAC however, was something neither of us had experience with. Feeding the DAC with data was easy. However, controlling the sound, having multiple tracks playing over each other and creating music required a lot of thinking. Having tested the different types of soundwaves, we learned that the triangle shape gave the smoothest sound but also the lowest.
