\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we where supposed to make sound effects by programming the development board in the C programming language. We where not allowed to use any operative systems. The finished program should use the dac to play some sounds, witch would be used in future assignments. The requirements where to make at least three different sound effects, and one start up melody. The learning outcome where the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{C programming}
	\item{GPIO control in C}
	\item{Use of the microcontroller's DAC and timers for sound generation.}
	\item{Interrupt handling in C}
\end{enumerate}
In addition to teaching about micro controllers, this course teaches students about energy efficiency. We will therefore take actions to develop an energy efficient application.
