\section{Introduction}
This assignment was about programming the development board in C without the support of an operative system. The finished program should use the dac to play some sounds, witch would be used in future assignments. The requirements where to make at least three different sound effects, and one start up melody. 
To complete this exercise, we first created a program with all the basics set up. This was a simple program generating a single tone throug the dac. Support for sound sequences with a sinlge track where then added. Lastly multi track sequences where supported. We defined a simple format for the sequences.
