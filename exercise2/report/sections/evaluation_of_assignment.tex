\section{Evaluation of Assignment}
We have had a lot of fun during this exercise. Playing around with different sounds, using a DAC to generate sound has been quite rewarding. There are however some opinions about this exercise that we would like to present. The first one being a lack of hints in the compendium. Energy efficiency conserned, we felt that we should have benn provided with more hints than the sentence:
\emph{ou can generate sound even with busy-waiting in a loop and writing to the DAC afterwards, but this will be very energy-inecient}\\
Also, we observed that many of the groups, us included, used some kind of tools other than the C language. We created a python script that generated C code. This shoul
