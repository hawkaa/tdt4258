\section{Aknowledgements}
As always, we could like to thank our student assistant, \emph{Benjamin Bjørnseth}, for assisting us at the lab hours. In addition to helping us with both technical and non-technical questions, Benjamin contributed in stimulating suggestions and encouragement.\\

In addition to Benjamin, we would also like to thank our lecturer \emph{Asbjørn Djupdal} for guidance regarding configuring the Linux kernel to run with tickless idle.
