\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Exercise focus}
This exercise opens up for a lot of things that can be done. We have decided to put our effort in writing a ridig and correct driver that follows the newest Linux standards and conventions. In addition to this, we have put effort in reducing the energy consumption of our system. We have decided to not spend much time on developing a fancy game, and hope to get rewarded for the driver software and energy effectiveness elaboration. 


\subsection{Why we did not use DMA}
Using the DMA to write to the frame buffer could be a way of improving the energy efficiency of our game. We concluded, under Benjamin's supervision, that there was no gain in doing this. This is because the game is interactive, and and we do not know in advance whether to move a player or not. In other words, on each clock tick, there is a numerous states that the game can be in, each giving a different output to the screen.
