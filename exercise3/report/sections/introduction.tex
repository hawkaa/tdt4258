\section{Introduction}
The task of this last exercise in TDT4258 is to make a computer game, along with a gamepad Linux driver so the game can be played. In addition to this a, we had to configure and compile a Linux distribution named \emph{uClinux}. 

The learning outcome of this exercise were the following (from \cite{compendium}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item C programming for Linux
	\item Programming Linux device drivers (compiling the Linux kernel, programming hardware in Linux, make your own device driver in Linux).
	\item Interacting with hardware through Linux device drivers.
\end{itemize}

In addition to this, energy efficiency is always a concern. Several suggestions regarding this matter is proposed in \cite{compendium}, including interrupt and signal implementation and optimizing frame buffer updates.
