\section{Introduction}
The task of this last exercise in TDT4258 is to make a computer game, along with a gamepad linux driver so the game can be played. In addition to this a Linux distribution by the name of uClinux had to be compiled.

The learning outcome of this exercise were the following (from \cite{compendium}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item C programming for Linux
	\item Programming linux device drivers (compiling the Linux kernel, programming hardware in Linux, make your own device driver in linux).
	\item Interacting with hardware through Linux device drivers.
\end{itemize}
