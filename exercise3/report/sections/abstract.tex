	This document describes how to write a Linux device driver for the EFM32GG-DK3750 to support a gamepad. For demonstration purposes, a simple game were made as a client of the driver. Both the client and the driver has been programmed using the C programming language with the support of \emph{uClinux}. Actions taken to keep the energy consumtion to a minimum, will also be described. Such were the enabling of tickless idle and the generation and handling of interrupts. In addition to this, the document elaborate on different ways of updating the frame buffer in order to find the most energy efficient method. We managed to implement the game successfully with good performance and no flaws, and found out that minimizing screen update areas has a huge impact on energy efficiency. By additionally enabling tickless idle, we mangaged to get the idle power consuption to an average of $11.46mA$.	\end{abstract}
