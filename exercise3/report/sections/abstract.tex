	This document describes how to write a Linux device driver for the EFM32GG-DK3750 to support a gamepad. For demonstration purposes, a simple game where made as a klient of the driver. Both the klient and the driver has been programmed using the C programming language with the support of \emph{uClinux}. Actions taken to keep the energy consumtion to a minimum, will also be described. Such where the enabling of tickless idle and the generation and handling of interrupts. Also different ways of updating the frame buffer where tried to find the most energy efficient method. When the game was running while none of us where interacting with it, we meassured the amperage to $11.46mA$.
