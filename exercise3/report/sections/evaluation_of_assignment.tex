\section{Evaluation of Assignment}
This assignment was in total a very good experience. We have had great learning outcome while developing our system. We have had many courses during our time at the university, but all of these have had a more theoretical approach. This exercise gave us the practical perspective of many things we have been taught, connecting dots and giving us a much better overview of how hardware interacts with software. \\

In addition to this, we appriciated that the compendium encouraged us to see other sources. Reading Linux Device Drivers and other online reference manuals gave us a very deep understanding of the functionality we were implementing. We feel that if all relevant information was written as a summary in the compendium, we would not have the same learing outcome. Being familiar to the mentioned book, as well as the Linux online documentation might come handy in the future. \\

We think that the development computers are too slow, and this can sometimes be quite frustrating. It is not ideal to keep our source files in the \emph{/tmp} directory, and even when its there, compiling takes time. We are aware that this system takes quite more resources to compile than the simple application we have developed in the previous tasks, but there is no secret that the computers are old and need an upgrade. Additionally, the air quality at the lab is horrible.
